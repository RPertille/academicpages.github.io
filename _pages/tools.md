### 2. ChillModels Package - Functions for Processing Chill and Heat Models for Temperate Fruit Trees

#### R package - contains procedures for calculate the chilling and heat accumulation for studies in the temperate fruit trees. The models in this package are:
- Utah (Richardson et al., 1974)
- PCU (Utah modified by Infruitec)
- GDH_A (Growing Degree Hours by Anderson et al., 1986)
- GDH_A (Growing Degree Hours by Richardon, 1974)
- North Carolina (Shaltout e Unrath, 1983)
- Landsberg Model, Q10 Model (Bidabe)
- Model by Jones et al. (2013)
- Low-Chill Model (Gilreath and Buchanan, 1981)
- Model for Cherry "Sweetheart" (Guak and Nielsen, 2013)
- Model for apple "Gala" (Guak and Nielsen, 2013)
- Dynamic Model (Fichmann, 1987) adapted of the "chillR" package
- Unified Model of Chuine (Chuine, I. et al. 2016)

The `ChillModels` package is hosted in GitHub. You can download it from GitHub using devtools package.

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RPertille/ChillModels")
